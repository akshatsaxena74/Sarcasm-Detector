# Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection in Twitter

This repository implements a multi-modal sarcasm detection system for Twitter, based on the hierarchical fusion approach described in "Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection in Twitter with Hierarchical Fusion Model" (Cai et al., ACL 2019). The model leverages **text**, **image**, and **image attribute** modalities, combining them through advanced fusion techniques to accurately detect sarcasm in multi-modal tweets.

## Overview

Sarcasm detection is a challenging task, especially on social media where users often combine text with images. This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline that:

- Extracts features from tweet text and attached images
- Predicts high-level image attributes using a pre-trained ResNet model
- Fuses information from all modalities using a hierarchical approach
- Outputs a sarcasm prediction for each tweet

The system achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging three distinct modalities and sophisticated fusion mechanisms.

## Architecture

### Raw and Guidance Vectors

**1. Image Modality**

- **Raw Image Vectors:**  
  A pre-trained and fine-tuned ResNet extracts 14×14 regional feature vectors from each input image, resulting in 196 raw image vectors per image.
- **Image Guidance Vector:**  
  The average of these 196 regional vectors forms the image guidance vector.

**2. Image Attribute Modality**

- **Raw Attribute Vectors:**  
  A separate ResNet model predicts 5 high-level attributes for each image. Each attribute is represented by its GloVe word embedding.
- **Attribute Guidance Vector:**  
  A weighted average (using an attention mechanism) of the 5 attribute embeddings forms the attribute guidance vector.

**3. Text Modality**

- **Raw Text Vectors:**  
  A Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) processes the tweet text. The hidden states at each time step (forward and backward) are concatenated to create the raw text vectors.
- **Text Guidance Vector:**  
  The average of all hidden states is used as the text guidance vector.

### Fusion Techniques

**1. Early Fusion**

- The attribute guidance vector is non-linearly transformed and used to initialize the hidden state of the Bi-LSTM. This allows image attribute information to be incorporated into the text modality from the start.

**2. Representation Fusion**

- Raw and guidance vectors from all three modalities are refined using attention mechanisms. This stage improves the feature representation of each modality by leveraging information from the others.

**3. Modality Fusion**

- The refined vectors from the three modalities are combined using a **weighted average** (not simple concatenation) to create a unified multimodal vector.

**4. Classification**

- The fused vector is passed through a two-layer fully connected neural network to predict whether the tweet is sarcastic or not.

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Core dependencies
pip install torch torchvision tensorflow
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
pip install pillow tqdm

# For text processing
pip install nltk
```

### Data Preparation

1. **Download GloVe Embeddings:**
```bash
wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.twitter.27B.zip
unzip glove.twitter.27B.zip -d glove_twitter/
```

2. **Prepare Dataset:**
   - Text data should be in format: `[image_id, tweet_text, label]`
   - Images should be in a single directory
   - Labels: 1 for sarcastic, 0 for non-sarcastic

### Training Pipeline

1. **Extract Text Features:**
```python
# Run final_code_textfeatures1-copy.ipynb
# This creates text embeddings and LSTM models
```

2. **Extract Image Attributes:**
```python
# Run attribute-feature-loading-the-model.ipynb
# This predicts image attributes using ResNet-101
```

3. **Extract Image Regional Features:**
```python
# Run image-guidance-part-sarcasm-detector.ipynb
# This creates 14×14 regional feature vectors
```

4. **Train Fusion Model:**
```python
# Run sarcasm-detector-final-code.ipynb
# This trains the complete hierarchical fusion model
```

### Making Predictions

```python
# Load the trained fusion model
fusion_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("sarcasm_fusion_model.h5")

# Process new image and text
predicted_attributes = process_image(image_path)
sample_attributes = attributes_to_embeddings(predicted_attributes, glove_embeddings, 200)
sample_text_seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text])
sample_text_seq_padded = pad_sequences(sample_text_seq, maxlen=75)

# Get prediction
prediction = fusion_model.predict([sample_text_seq_padded, sample_attributes])
is_sarcastic = prediction[0][0] >= 0.5
```

## Dataset

The model expects multi-modal tweet data consisting of:

- **Text:** Tweet content (preprocessed and tokenized)
- **Image:** Associated image file (JPG/PNG format)
- **Label:** Binary classification (1 = sarcastic, 0 = non-sarcastic)

### Data Format

**Training Data:**
```
[image_id, "tweet text content", label]
```

**Image Processing:**
- Images resized to 448×448 pixels
- Divided into 14×14 regions (196 patches of 32×32)
- Normalized using ImageNet statistics

**Text Processing:**
- Maximum sequence length: 75 tokens
- GloVe Twitter embeddings (200-dimensional)
- Special tokens: `<user>`, `<unk>`

## Model Performance

The hierarchical fusion model demonstrates superior performance compared to single-modality approaches:

- **Text-only (Bi-LSTM):** ~77% accuracy
- **Image-only:** ~65% accuracy  
- **Attribute-only:** ~63% accuracy
- **Concatenation (3 modalities):** ~79% accuracy
- **Hierarchical Fusion (Our Model):** ~80% accuracy

### Key Findings

1. **Modality Importance:** Text > Image Attributes > Raw Images
